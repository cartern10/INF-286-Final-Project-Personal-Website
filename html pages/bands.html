                AJR's music is mostly comprised of dubstep, pop, and electric pop. These three genres are my favorite so putting all three together will have me enjoying any song they
                put out. I originally discovered the band in 2015 and have been enjoying their music since. The song that caught my attention was called 'I'm Ready' where it included SpongeBob
                saying his iconic line, "I'm Ready," this combined with myself never really having heard electric pop music made me really enjoy their music and created the gateway to
                most music I listen to today.

                I don't remember where or when I started listening to this artist, but I've listened to them for some time now. This artist' genre is electric pop and dance music. I
                enjoy and treasure this artist so much because while dance music isn't to far from electric pop it has such an intensity I've never heard. I didn't know music can be so
                packed of energy. This artist helped me discover new music and for as long as I can remember it's changed the way I listen to music.

                Call Me Karizma is an interesting artist consisting of a mix of pop and rap. This is another Artist I don't know when I originally started listening to. This artist
                has impacted the way I listen to music due to the lyrics of songs. For most music I pay little attention to the lyrics due to mostly listening to music in the background
                of my other activities. Call Me Karizma is one of the few that I actively engage the lyrics because of the messages behind them. Mostly dealing with how cruel some
                things in life can be, while keeping a very well written beat in the background of him singing. The music''s lyrics also seem to have little regard with the feelings of
                those who listen to it, which is another reason I enjoy his music since he doesn't tailor it to anyone but him.

                Rock is a genre I usually don't listen to very often. Twenty One Pilots is a band that I will enjoy listening to any day. I've started listening to this band back in
                high school and still actively listen to to this day. This was another artist that changed my view on music. I discovered this band around the same time I
                discovered AJR. Growing up in a small country town, I had regularly heard country music. I wasn't the biggest fan of country, so I didn't listen to music much. Twenty One
                Pilots and AJR helped change this and help me discover something that is my favorite thing.

                The other four bands or artist on this list have all been very fast paced, high energy. While not slow, Juniper Value doesn't go face and high energy while still creating pop.
                Juniper Vale has become a perfect middle ground when I don't want lo-fi but I'm not wanting high energy music.
